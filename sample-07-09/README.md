# FIDO2 WebAuthn TypeScript Lib

Formally, this sample was a demonstration code to show how the FIDO2 WebAuthn works in you browser via `karma` test codes invoked by `yarn`.

Recent changes of package managers, `yarn` is now a bit obsolete and `pnpm` becomes more popular. However, `karma` doesn't work with `pnpm`, and hence we decided to gradually migrate our demonstration style from this Node.js version to another one.

In 2023 lecture class, we implemented a rust-version of FIDO2 WebAuthn server for demonstration, and **this TypeScrypt codes is currently used as a library called from the frontend of the server**. This means the code is not directly used for demonstration.
